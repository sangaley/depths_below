//! Faction stations: each faction parks its station by the capital of its
//! systems (the biggest planet), and the Terran Hegemony rings its with gun
//! platforms. Dock with F, and the station's prices are set by your standing
//! (see `StandingTier::station_prices`); a faction that counts you Hostile
//! won't let you in, and its station shoots.
//!
//! A station is an AI ship with no engines, anchored to its planet: it rides
//! the planet's orbit just outside it, on the side away from the star. It
//! exists as entities only while you are near it, so a system's station costs
//! nothing while you are on the far side of the system.
