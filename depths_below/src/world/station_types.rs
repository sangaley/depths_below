// outpost is deterministically assigned one of the other types — stable
// across a run (seeded by station index), giving each outpost an actual
// identity instead of being an interchangeable resupply blob with an
// arbitrary price hash. Type drives both what an outpost pays well for
// (sell prices) and what it's cheap to buy from it (service costs).
