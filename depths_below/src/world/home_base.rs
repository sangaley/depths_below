// Every star system carries STATIONS_PER_SYSTEM full stations, spread wide
// around that system's own space. They are all "full" stations: dock with F
// and you get the shipyard (build mode), the shop, the bounty board and the
// hiring hall, exactly like Haven — the old model had thirteen stations
// crammed into Haven's system alone, twelve of them resupply-only blobs you
// could do nothing with but sell cargo, and every other system in the galaxy
// had none at all.
//
// Haven (system 0, slot 0) keeps its fixed position: it's where the ship
// spawns and where the berth is.
