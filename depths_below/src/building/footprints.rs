// FOOTPRINTS
//
// Every module occupies the plain WxH rectangle its `ModuleDef.size` names.
// What a block claims on the grid is exactly what its sprite covers, and the
// two cannot disagree.
//
// There WAS a table here of non-rectangular shapes -- an L-tromino corner
// plate, a T-tetromino sickbay and bridge wing, an S-tetromino staggered
// plate, plus-pentomino hubs -- each picked for what the module does. They
// read well on paper and badly on screen: `size` is the bounding box, so the
// sprite covered six cells while a T-shaped sickbay owned four, and the two
// corners it did not own were painted over the corridor beside it. Cutting
// the art to the shape fixed the overlap and left blocks whose silhouette did
// not match anything else on the hull. Squares won.
//
// The hook stays because it costs nothing and threading it back through
// ShipGrid, navigation and the spawner would be the expensive part. Add a
// shape here and `vfx::footprint_tiles` in the history (dd5674d) is the code
// that cuts its art to match -- a non-rectangular block needs both or it
// overlaps its neighbours again.
