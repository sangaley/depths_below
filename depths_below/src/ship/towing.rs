//! Towing a hulk home.
//!
//! Stripping a wreck where it died already works: crew suit up, cross over,
//! and carry it back a piece at a time. That stays. Towing is the other
//! option, and the point is that it is a *choice* rather than an upgrade.
//!
//! Strip in place and you get what a boarding party can carry — scrap and
//! common goods, quickly, and you leave whenever you like. Drag the whole
//! hulk to a station and the yard opens it properly: everything still aboard,
//! plus the rare classes a crewman cannot pry loose and carry home through
//! vacuum.
//!
//! The cost is the trip. A hulk under tow adds its mass to yours, so you
//! accelerate and turn like something much heavier, and it makes noise, which
//! is already what draws hunters. Scavengers are meanwhile eating whatever you
//! left behind. One at a time.
