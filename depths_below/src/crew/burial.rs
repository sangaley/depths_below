//! Burial at space.
//!
//! When the shooting stops, a free hand carries the dead to an airlock and puts
//! them out. The body does not despawn and is never cleaned up: it drifts, and
//! it is still drifting if you come back to that system a hundred hours later.
//!
//! That permanence is the whole point, so the bodies do NOT live only as
//! entities — entities die with the system when you warp out of it. They live
//! in `DriftingDead`, which is saved with the game, and entities are spawned
//! from it whenever their system is the one you're standing in. Same shape as
//! `sync_station_entities`: the resource is the truth, the entities are a view
//! of whichever slice of it is currently loaded.
//!
//! Nothing here removes a body. A scavenger/cleaner faction is the intended
//! answer to that, and it is a faction problem rather than a crew one.
