//! Crew walking about inside the ship.
//!
//! Split the way the AI ships are: `plan_crew_destinations` and
//! `plan_crew_paths` think on a timer, `walk_crew` moves every frame. A* over
//! a whole ship is far too expensive to redo per frame, and stepping has to be
//! smooth, so the two cannot share a cadence.
//!
//! Crew walk in ship-LOCAL space as children of the ship, so the hull can spin
//! and manoeuvre underneath them without any of it reaching this file.
//!
//! Deliberately does NOT touch `CrewMember::state`. `CrewState::Moving` exists
//! and is unused, but `crew_repair_system` and `crew_rebuild_system` both count
//! `Idle` crew as work capacity, so flipping walkers to `Moving` would quietly
//! slow repair and reconstruction. Whether walking should cost you that is a
//! real design question, and it gets answered when walking gains teeth — not
//! as a side effect of making crew visible. Until then the presence of
//! `CrewPath` is what "this person is walking" means.
