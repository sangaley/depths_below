//! Which hulls each faction flies.
//!
//! A faction used to be one design: every Terran ship was the same Terran
//! ship. Now a faction has a roster of classes, from scouts up to capitals,
//! plus the civilians and oddities its lore calls for. Each class is a
//! hand-drawn design at `designs/factions/<slug>/<key>.json`, approved on the
//! fleet concepts page (tools/fleet-concepts).
//!
//! A faction with an empty roster flies its one original design,
//! `designs/factions/<slug>.json`, exactly as before. So does any class whose
//! file is missing.
