//! What an enemy ship knows about the fight it's in, and what it does about it.
//!
//! Four times a second every fighting hull is surveyed: its reach, its live
//! firepower, what it has lost, its shields, who it's shooting. Each AI ship
//! reads that picture against its own state -- who is hurting it, how fast it
//! is dying, whether its side is winning, whether missiles are coming -- and
//! settles on a `Tactic`, which the brain (who to shoot, whether to run), the
//! helm (what range to hold, how to weave) and the guns (what to aim at, when
//! to launch) all act on.
//!
//! Faction character stays: `temperament` is how much of this each one uses.
//! The Choir are ghosts and the Eternal never retreat. The weights in `Mind`
//! are what tools/combat-lab/train.py tunes against real fights.
