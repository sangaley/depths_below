/// AI ships in Engaging state fire weapons at their current AiShipTarget —
/// the player OR another AI ship, whichever ai_brain picked this tick (see
/// AiShipTarget's doc comment). WHO to target is only re-decided every
/// 0.25s (the brain tick); WHERE to aim is re-read from that target's live
/// Transform every single frame this system runs — AiShipTarget.position is
/// a snapshot from the moment it was picked, stale by up to 0.25s, which
/// was enough for an orbiting/strafing ship (standard combat maneuver, see
/// movement.rs's standoff-orbit) to be gone from that point by the time a
/// shot arrived. Live lookup fixes shots consistently whiffing at range.
///
/// Two upgrades layered on top of that live aim, both to make enemies an
/// actual threat: LEAD PREDICTION — shots aim where the target WILL be, via
/// the same calculate_lead the player's own guns use, so a moving ship no
/// longer simply outruns enemy fire; and SUBSYSTEM AIMING — per-faction
/// aim_priority sends rounds at a specific enemy module (your weapons /
/// engines / reactor) instead of the hull centre, cached on
/// AiShipTarget.subsystem and re-picked when it's destroyed. Damage is
/// resolved by impact geometry, so aiming a shot at your engine genuinely
/// knocks out your engine. Empty-doctrine factions keep aiming centre-of-mass.
/// Whether a ship should be shooting at all this tick.
///
/// Behaviour alone used to be the whole gate, and `ai_brain_system` skips
/// destroyed ships entirely -- so a dead ship's behaviour froze at whatever it
/// held when it died. Anything that went down fighting stayed `Engaging` and
/// kept firing out of a hull the player had just been told was "derelict
/// adrift, ripe for salvage". Salvage is the loop the demo is built around;
/// being shot by the thing you came to board is not a difficulty curve.
///
/// A reactor meltdown is deliberately still armed: `tick_reactor_meltdown`
/// only sets `is_destroyed` at detonation, so the eight seconds of berserk
/// fire between breach and blast survive this check.
