//! What an enemy ship shows of itself, and what comes out when you open one.
//!
//! An enemy used to be a flat dark slab. Its hull carried no hallway cells, so
//! there was no inside to look at, and every block it did have drew at full
//! brightness whether or not you had any business seeing it.
//!
//! Now the deck is derived at spawn like the player's, and everything inboard
//! starts concealed: the ship reads as a closed hull until you breach it, and
//! then only the few cells around the hole come up. You learn a ship by taking
//! it apart, which is the same thing the salvage loop already asks you to do.
//!
//! Crew come out of the hole too. They are never given bodies while alive --
//! AI crew deliberately carry no Transform, which is what keeps them out of
//! every player-only walking, repair and burial system without a single
//! exclusion filter to maintain. A vented crewman is chosen by headcount, the
//! same trick `AmmoHitBehavior::Irradiate` uses, and the body is spawned at
//! the hole rather than at a position the living crewman never had.
