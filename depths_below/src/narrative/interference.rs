//! The instruments stop being trustworthy.
//!
//! Ported from `src/parked/abyss_horror.rs`, which is 812 finished lines that
//! were compiled out because they depended on live creature AI and, with
//! creature spawning off, produced "false scares with nothing behind them".
//! Only some of that file needs creatures. The instrument, camera and tint
//! work does not, and under this story a reading with nothing behind it is
//! the point rather than the bug.
//!
//! One rule carried over from the original, and it is the whole craft of it:
//! **a fake reading is formatted exactly like a real one**. A depth that
//! scrambles to "ERR" while every other gauge reads normally is a UI bug. A
//! depth that quietly reads a plausible wrong number is a haunted instrument.
//! The formats below mirror what `update_hud` actually writes, which is not
//! what the parked file assumed — the HUD was redesigned since it was written,
//! and a straight port would have produced "Hull: ???" next to a gauge that
//! now renders "100%".
//!
//! One thing that fell out of this and is worth keeping: only the numbers are
//! overwritten, not the bars beneath them. So a corrupted readout shows 46%
//! hull above a full green bar, and the ship is visibly disagreeing with
//! itself rather than simply going dark. That is a better effect than a
//! blackout and it costs nothing — leave the bars alone.
