// ============================================================================
// GUIDED TUTORIAL
// A "Flight Training" card teaches a new pilot the whole loop — and the ideas
// behind it, not just the keys. It alternates two kinds of step:
//   * ACTION steps advance when the player performs the action (thrust, ping,
//     kill, salvage, dock, build, ...).
//   * INFO steps (Advance::Continue) explain a concept — what the HUD means,
//     why the ship is modular, how the salvage economy works — and advance on
//     [Space]. Nothing is on a timer, so a slow reader is never rushed.
//
// The combat lesson is a real encounter. When the player reaches the scan step
// a single weak Rust Swarm raider is spawned OFF-SCREEN but inside radar range,
// so the player has to ping to find its bearing and fly out to it. Its weapons
// are clamped to a short range (`tame_tutorial_enemy`) so it holds near its
// spawn instead of charging across the system. It dies into a real wreck
// (ai_ship::wreck) the player then strips with a crew. Home space (Haven) is
// otherwise safe, so this is the player's only contact during training.
//
// It only arms on a brand-new expedition (never on a loaded save) and vanishes
// the moment training is done, so it stays out of the way of returning players.
// ============================================================================
