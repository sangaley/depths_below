// ============================================================================
// DEMO / SELF-PLAYTEST MODE — dev tooling, not a game feature.
// Three independent env-gated modes:
//   DEPTHS_DEMO=1       — full autopilot: skips the menu, flies toward and
//                          fires at the nearest enemy, saves periodic engine
//                          screenshots. Used for unattended log-based testing.
//   DEPTHS_SKIP_MENU=1  — skips the menu/station sequence only. Drops
//                          straight into Exploring with the starter ship,
//                          the normal 37-ship world simulation, and full
//                          manual control (no autopilot).
//   DEPTHS_SHOTS=<n>    — engine-side screenshot every n seconds during
//                          NORMAL play: no autopilot, no menu skip, nothing
//                          else changed. F7 takes one on demand. Captures the
//                          render target, not the display, so it never
//                          photographs whatever app happens to be in front.
//                          It CANNOT see through a window that is fully
//                          covered: macOS stops that window drawing, and the
//                          frames come back black. Use DEPTHS_OFFSCREEN for
//                          anything run in the background.
//                          Dir: DEPTHS_SHOTS_DIR (default /tmp/depths_shots).
//   DEPTHS_OFFSCREEN=1  — render into an image instead of the window, so
//                          capture works however buried the window is. The
//                          window itself shows nothing; for unattended runs.
//   DEPTHS_START_SYSTEM=<id|Faction|haunt>[:fleet|:capital|:approach] — jump there a few
//                          seconds in (:approach parks ~12 km out from the capital's
//                          starport, the station between you and its world).
//   DEPTHS_SHOW_SHIPS=1 — every AI ship drawn whole (no hidden interior), with the
//                          zoomed-out roof the player's ship has; faction stations
//                          in their textures' own colours, untinted.
//   DEPTHS_FLY_TO=station — autopilot to the nearest station: turn, burn, brake,
//                          press F. For filming an approach and docking.
//   DEPTHS_ZOOM=<z> — hold the camera at that zoom (1.8 default, 20 furthest out).
//   DEPTHS_ZOOM_RAMP=<from>:<to>:<secs>[:<delay>] — ease the zoom from one value
//                          to another over <secs> of real time, starting
//                          <delay> real seconds after launch. For filming.
//   DEPTHS_HIDE_UI=1 — hide every UI root (HUD, markers, cursor): world only.
//   DEPTHS_NO_BG_PLANETS=1 — hide the small parallax planets behind everything.
//   DEPTHS_CAM_AT=<x>,<y> | station[>d] — point the camera there instead of at
//                          the ship ("station": the nearest station core; ">d"
//                          slides d units toward its world).
//   DEPTHS_SHOTS_AFTER=<secs> — with DEPTHS_SHOTS, don't start capturing
//                          until that many real seconds after launch.
//   DEPTHS_KEYS=<script> — tap keys at set times, e.g. "3:KeyM,5:F7,8:Escape".
//                          "6:Minus~3" HOLDS a key for 3s instead -- needed
//                          for anything read with `pressed` rather than
//                          `just_pressed`, like camera zoom.
//                          Seconds of REAL time, so autoplay's time dilation
//                          can't shift it. F7 is the capture key, so a script
//                          can walk the screens and photograph each one.
//                          Goes through the same ButtonInput press the
//                          autoplay director and the gamepad bridge use --
//                          never OS keystrokes, which land in whatever app is
//                          focused rather than the game.
//   DEPTHS_CASCADE=0.85 — pin the story's progress level, so a late beat can
//                          be looked at without an hour of flying first.
//   DEPTHS_CASCADE_TRACE=1 — print the arc's state once a second.
//   DEPTHS_BUILD_TAB=<name> — stop at the station, open build mode and select
//                          that build tab, so the palette can be looked at
//                          without clicking through to it. Name matches
//                          BuildCategory::name() case-insensitively
//                          ("structural", "life support", "hull").
//   DEPTHS_BUILD_SLOT=<n> — with the above, park on slot n instead of the
//                          first, to check the far end of a scrolling strip.
//   DEPTHS_BUILD_LAUNCH=<s> — with the above, launch after s seconds with the
//                          build menu still open. Build overlays are drawn in
//                          world space and torn down by systems that only run
//                          at the berth, so leaving that way is exactly how
//                          they get stranded there.
//   DEPTHS_CAM_TRACE=1  — once a second, log how far the camera sat from the
//                          ship along its travel, and how much that wobbled
//                          (camera.rs). For judder at speed.
//   DEPTHS_DEBUG=1      — enable the backtick debug menu (debug.rs). A launch
//                          without it has no debug menu at all.
//   DEPTHS_MOVETEST=1   — bare movement sandbox: instant skip (no menu/
//                          station flash), starter ship, manual control,
//                          and NO AI ships spawned — just open space and
//                          stars, for isolating flight feel from everything
//                          else.
//   DEPTHS_SAVE_TRACE=1 — print what a save has to bring back (orbital clock,
//                          planet positions, which ship each bounty points
//                          at) at every save, and for six seconds of flight
//                          after a load, so the two line up in the log.
//   DEPTHS_BOUNTY=1     — accept one bounty on a ship in a neighbouring system
//                          as soon as there is a simulation, for when no board
//                          nearby posts one (autoplay then hunts it down).
