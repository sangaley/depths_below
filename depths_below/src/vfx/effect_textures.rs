// EFFECT TEXTURES
//
// Handles for the soft effect art, loaded once at startup and passed to the
// spawn helpers. Modelled on `audio::GameAudio`, which does the same thing for
// the ~43 sound clips: one resource of handles, filled by a Startup system
// with literal paths. There is no asset manifest or folder scan in this
// project, so this is where "which PNGs are effects" is written down.
//
// The textures are pure white with the shape carried in alpha, because a Bevy
// `Sprite.color` MULTIPLIES its texture. Every spawn site already picks a
// meaningful colour — the missile trail rolls a grey per puff, `Blast` lerps
// hot to cool across an explosion's life, projectiles tint per ammo type — so
// baking colour into the art would apply it twice and quietly break the
// readability those colours exist to provide.
// ============================================================================
