//! Hull tiles that join up instead of stacking their frames.
//!
//! Every hull texture carries its own frame and corner fastenings, so two
//! neighbours drew two frames and a ship read as a grid of loose plates rather
//! than one surface. Each tile now picks one of sixteen versions of itself
//! from which of its four neighbours use the same texture, with the frame
//! lifted off the sides that touch a match.
//!
//! Two tiles match when they would load the same image, not when their layer
//! or material fields happen to be equal. That is the rule that makes Outer
//! and Inner steel merge with each other -- they are the same picture -- while
//! a corridor meeting a wall keeps its line, which is exactly where a line
//! belongs.
//!
//! A destroyed tile is not a neighbour. Blow a hole in a hull and the frame
//! comes back around the edge of the hole on its own, because the cells beside
//! it stop finding a match there.
