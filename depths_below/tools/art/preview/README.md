# Art previews

Candidate sprites rendered by `tools/art/blender/`. **Nothing here is live** --
the game still loads everything from `assets/sprites/`. These are proposals.

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `railgun_CURRENT_in_game.png` | What the game renders today (base + barrel) |
| `railgun_side_by_side.png` | Current vs proposed, same scale |
| `railgun_at_game_size.png` | Both at real combat zoom (66px, nearest-neighbour 4x) |
| `railgun_assembled.png` | Proposed base + barrel composited |
| `railgun_base.png` | Proposed base plate alone (378x378) |
| `railgun_barrel.png` | Proposed barrel alone (300x300, spans 2 cells) |
