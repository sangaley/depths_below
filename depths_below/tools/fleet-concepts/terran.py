"""Terran Hegemony, round 2: hand-drawn, top-down only.

Lore: the present-day Hegemony. Humanist, military, and losing. Their past self
(the Eternal Hegemony) still fights as if it won; this one is racing to stop
its own future, and its sensors are said to see thirty seconds ahead.

Grammar, held at every size (all of it reads from above):
  - an ARROWHEAD BOW with a plate on every step of both raked faces;
  - square GUN SPONSONS out on port and starboard: a gun on the outer face,
    a magazine behind it, a deck running back to the keel;
  - ENGINE NACELLES as pods at the stern corners, plus a centre engine bank;
  - a KEEL corridor down the centreline with the bridge in the middle of the
    ship, never at an edge;
  - port/starboard symmetric, Titanium.
