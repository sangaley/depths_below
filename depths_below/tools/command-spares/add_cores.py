"""Gives the big faction ships spare command: two AI Combat Cores (or a spare
Helm Station where only one cell can be had), each
placed as far from the bridge and from each other as the hull allows, at
least two cells in from the outer hull. These ships have no empty interior,
so a core takes the place of filler (see FILLER) lying wholly inside its
cells, and never a corridor.

A ship strikes its colours when every bridge, helm and AI core it was built
with is gone (ai_ship::combat::check_ai_cripple). With all of them in one
bridge cluster, two hits next to each other ended a capital.

Run from depths_below/: python3 tools/command-spares/add_cores.py [--dry-run]
Re-running is safe: a ship that already has three command spots is left alone.
