"""Doubles every ship in the game and arms it with the new weapons.

Each ship is grown to the new scale by drawing it twice as big: every cell
of its hand-drawn hull becomes a 2x2 block, so its silhouette, rooms,
corridors and armour belts stay exactly where they were drawn, and every
system scales together (four reactors where there was one, four bunks,
four engines). A 45-degree armour plate becomes a full plate and two angled
ones along the same line, so angled faces stay straight.

The old one-block guns, missiles and lasers are taken out and their cells
become slots for the new weapons, placed as the builder's pre-made weapons
(designs/kits) in each faction's style:

- Gatling           -> Light Autocannon turrets
- Cannon, Railgun   -> 170 mm turrets on a 3x3 ring where there's room,
                       else the Compact 170 mm; a big enough block of them
                       takes a Twin 225 mm turret
- missiles          -> VLS silos with the faction's missile
- Laser             -> laser units firing the way the old laser faced
- PD drone          -> CIWS turrets

The exotics -- Ion Disruptor, Plasma Caster, EMP Pulse, Tractor Beam,
Mining Drill -- are faction identity with no new version; they scale like
everything else. An Ammo Bay scales to one bay and three Supply Crates, so
cook-offs don't grow fourfold. Every armed ship gets point defence (CIWS)
and Missile Warners with a decoy and chaff beside one.

Sources: each ship as approved (git 957d6bb, before any weapon swaps); the
Eternal Vigil as built (it came later). Writes designs/factions/*/*.json
and the player's starter, pincer, crab and trident.
