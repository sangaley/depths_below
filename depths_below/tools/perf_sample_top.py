"""Rank the game's own functions in a macOS `sample` call graph by inclusive time.

    tools/perf_sample_top.py game.sample.txt [top_n]

Each line of the call graph is "<indent><count> <function> ...". A function's
inclusive count is summed over the nodes where it is NOT already on the stack
above (so recursion isn't double counted), across every thread. Only
depths_below:: functions are listed, with Rust hashes and generics trimmed so
one system reads as one row.
